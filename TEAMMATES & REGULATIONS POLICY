    Breaks should not disrupt work or stretch beyond reasonable limits.


3. Mobile Phone Usage

    In-office Employees:

        Personal mobile use during working hours is strictly discouraged.

        Keep devices on silent or vibrate mode.

        Emergency use allowed — step away to designated area.

    Remote Employees:

        Keep distractions minimal during working hours.

        Continuous or repeated mobile use during work hours may lead to disciplinary action.


4. Attendance & Punctuality

    Late arrivals (more than 3 times a month) will result in warnings or salary deduction.

    Employees must inform HR in advance if they’re running late or absent.

    Three unapproved absences in a row = absconding case.


5. Leave Policy

    Leaves must be applied via email or company portal at least 3 days in advance (except in emergencies).

    Paid leaves and casual leaves are granted based on management discretion.

    Uninformed or excessive leaves may lead to deductions or termination.


6. Dress Code

    Maintain smart casual or formal attire during office hours.

    No slippers, shorts, or inappropriate clothing in the office premises.


7. Device, Data & Tool Usage

    Company laptops, email, and tools must be used only for assigned work.

    Do not use office devices for personal work, social media, or freelancing.

    Any attempt to tamper, delete, or misuse company data/tools is a criminal offense.


8. Behavior & Professional Conduct

    Abusive language, disrespect, gossip, or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

    Maintain a professional tone in Slack, calls, emails, and meetings.

    Avoid unnecessary politics, rumor-spreading, or interference in others' work.


9. Workspace Etiquette

    Keep your desk clean and organized.

    Loud music, shouting, or personal phone calls on speaker are prohibited.

    Respect shared spaces — meeting rooms, pantry, restrooms.


10. Secondary Work

    Freelancing or side projects (paid or unpaid) are not allowed during employment unless explicitly approved in writing.


11. Confidentiality & Data Protection

    All internal data, scripts, documents, strategies, or credentials are confidential.

    Sharing, saving, or forwarding such information without authorization will lead to legal action.


12. Resignation & Exit

    A 2-month written notice is mandatory before exit.

    Sudden exit without notice = No pending dues cleared.

    Employees leaving must return all company assets and clear offboarding formalities.


13. Defamation Policy

    Any public or private defamation, negative reviews, or attempts to damage company reputation — during or after employment — will result in strict legal action.


14. Policy Updates

    These policies are subject to updates without prior notice. Continued employment implies agreement to abide by the latest version.

    Acknowledgment

    All employees are expected to read, understand, and comply with these rules. Ignorance of policy is not an excuse.
